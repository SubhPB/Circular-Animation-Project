# Circular Animation Project by Byimaan
This project showcases an interactive circular animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on GSAP  for smooth and powerful animations.

## Features
Dynamic Circular Interface: A large, circular element dominating the viewport, creating a visually striking effect.
Interactive Stripes: Multiple stripes positioned around the circle, each representing different categories such as "Quality", "Html", "Python", etc., with corresponding ratings.
Interactive Panel: A side panel with buttons allowing users to rotate the circle to different angles, revealing different stripes.
Animated Text: The "BYIMAAN" text is animated, adding a dynamic touch to the top right corner of the page.

## Technologies Used
HTML: Structuring the web page elements.
CSS: Styling the elements, including the circle, stripes, and panel.
JavaScript: Adding interactivity and controlling the animations.
GSAP: Used for creating smooth, professional animations for the rotating circle and the animated text.
